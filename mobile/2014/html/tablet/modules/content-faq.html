              Most restaurants accept large party reservations on a limited basis for dining during 
              quieter times (such as weekday afternoons or early lunch immediately after we open). 
              We usually do not take reservations for dining during busy times such as evenings, 
              weekends or holidays. We seat guests in the order that they arrive once the entire 
              party is present.

              Arrive early or dine late!  Most restaurants are busiest from 12 - 2PM and 6 - 8PM on 
              weekdays. Weekends can be busy all day. Our entire menu with full service is always 
              available at our self-seating “high top” tables located in our bar areas. Also, almost 
              everything on our menu can be ordered as takeout by phone or at our bakery counters. 
              Most locations offer Curbside To-Go service. Call ahead, pull up, call us and we’ll 
              run your food out to you.

              Yes! Our open floor plans allow us to easily accommodate large parties. Many restaurants 
              accept reservations for large parties on a limited basis at quieter times (see above).
